- Fully animated orbits of all 8 planets
- Realistic planetary textures and sizes
- Interactive camera (rotate, zoom, pan)
- Speed sliders for individual planets
- Pause/Resume animation control
- Light and dark theme toggle
- Tooltip on hover displaying planet name, orbit radius, and speed
- Dynamic starfield background
